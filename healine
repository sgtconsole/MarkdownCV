I have over 6 years of international experience working in end-to-end recruitment in New Zealand, Australia and London. 
My experience as a Talent Search Consultant with Bacardi has enabled me to equip myself with a mindset where I am always looking to simplify processes and improve efficiency whilst looking for the best talent in multiple disciplines and markets. This was evident from the automated video tool I championed which led to a faster and more effective turnaround time in the search for top talent. With a keen attention to detail, a data-driven mindset and a strong motivation for adding value, I’m confident that I will be a great asset to any organisation on the search for a Business Analyst.
 
I believe being a team player who enjoys collaboration, goes a long way when you are operating across multiple domains to communicate and understand different and competing needs. I have a proven track record in translating stakeholder requirements into tangible deliverables that exceed expectations in terms of time to hire and the quality of candidates hired, working on multiple projects simultaneously. Strong communication skills have helped me act as an effective liaison between cross functional hiring managers and candidates to reduce ambiguity and increase strategic focus.
My ample experience coupled with my aptitude for creating effective strategies help me to thrive in enterprise roles. Which is why I’m looking for a new opportunity that will both challenge and excite me whilst allowing me to progress on the path of business analytics, strategy and delivering value.
